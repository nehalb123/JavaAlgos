### 0/1 Knapsack

**Problem Statement:** Given a set of n items numbered from 1 up
to n, each with a weight wi and a value vi, along with a 
maximum weight capacity W, **_maximize the sum of the values_** of 
the items in the knapsack so that the **_sum of the weights is 
less than or equal to the knapsack's capacity_**.

What is 0/1? -> items cannot be broken which means we should
take the item as a whole or should leave it.
