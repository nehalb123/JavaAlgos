##Trees ðŸŒ³

####Properties:
    1.  Trees do not contain a cycle.
    2.  Tree with 'n' nodes has 'n-1' edges

### Construct a tree from traversal

#### Will you be able to construct a tree uniquely?

From a **preorder traversal** we have only information about root, but we donâ€™t know up to which part is its left subtree 
and which is right subtree. Actually we can construct Catalan(n) number of trees from its preorder traversal where 
`Catalan(n)` is `nth Catalan number`

Same goes for inorder, postorder traversal too. <span style="color:#ED8B76">So, itâ€™s confirmed that we canâ€™t convert to a 
unique binary tree from only one traversal.</span> So we need at least two. But is it possible for any two condition?

1. Inorder & preorder: We can construct a unique binary tree from its preorder & inorder traversals.
2. Inorder & postorder: We can construct a unique binary tree from its postorder & inorder traversals.
3. Postorder & preorder: We <span style="color:#ED8B76">can't</span> construct a unique binary tree from its preorder & postorder traversals.

### Construct a tree from inorder and preorder:

1.  Preorder gives us the root.
2.  Find this root in inorderMap
3.  Recursively repeat the process until you are 
left with a single node. Attach the nodes when recursion is unrolling. <br><br>
