The following are some of the most popular data structures used for indexing data:

🔹`Skiplist:` a common in-memory index type. Used in Redis.

🔹`Hash index:` a very common implementation of the “Map” data structure (or “Collection”)

🔹`SSTable:` immutable on-disk “Map” implementation

🔹`LSM tree:` Skiplist + SSTable. High write throughput.

🔹`B-tree:` disk-based solution. Consistent read/write performance.

🔹`Inverted index:` used for document indexing. Used in Lucene.

🔹`Suffix tree:` for string pattern search.

🔹`R-tree:` multi-dimension search, such as finding the nearest neighbor.
