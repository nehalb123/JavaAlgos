##Priority Queues

1.  Time Complexity to build a heap:
    

2.  <i>Time Complexity to insert</i>: <br>
    In the **worst case**, we need one swap at each level of 
    the tree. So the total number of the swaps would be 
    equal to the height of the heap tree. The height of a 
    balanced complete tree with N number of nodes is `log N`.
    Each swap takes `O(1)` time.
    <br> <br>
    Time taken to insert a node: `O(log N)`
