### Skip List

1.  **_Sorted linked lists_** with skip pointers.


2.  A skip list is a probabilistic data structure that allows
`O(log n)` search complexity as well as `O(log n)` insertion 
complexity within an ordered sequence of `n` elements. 
Thus it can get the **_best features of a sorted array 
(for searching) while maintaining a linked list-like 
structure_** that allows insertion, which is not possible 
in an array.
